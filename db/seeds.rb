# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# puts 'Destroy Database...'

# Company.destroy_all
# User.destroy_all
# Project.destroy_all
# Collaboration.destroy_all

# puts 'Creating Database...'

# company_0 = Company.create(name:"The big company")

# user_0 = User.create(first_name:"John", last_name:"Lascience", country:"France", city:"Paris", function:"Fellow researcher", school:"Harvar University", phone:"+33 1 42 61 65 34", email:"john@john.com", password:"password")

# project_0 = Project.create(name:"Hydrolic model conception", description:"We built Devise to help you quickly develop an application that uses authentication. However, we don't want to be in your way when you need to customize it.")

# # collaboration_0 = Collaboration.create(project_id:"0", user_id:"0", joined:"true")
